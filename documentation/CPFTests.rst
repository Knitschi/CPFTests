\section CPFTests

A package that contains automated tests of the CMakeProjectFramework.
This package is not intended to be used by clients, but rather implements mid- and high-level tests of
the CPF. As the tests in this package may test multiple packages at once and require some test setup-code
to be run, they where put in their own package.
